/**
 * This is the main entry point for requirejs in this application. This file is
 * used as the second stop in the require.config chain by the following
 * initial require.config calls:
 *
 * - tasks/requirejs.js, used by grunt-contrib-requirejs for production builds
 * - test/index.html used by mocha in the browser and mocha_phantomjs
 * - test/main.karma.js used by the karma test runner
 * - public/index.html used by you while you develop your app
 *
 * In all cases, this file is the __second__ link of the requirejs configuration
 * chain, which is why it does not have a `baseUrl`. The job of this file
 * is to set up paths shared by all consumers of requirejs in this app.
 *
 * When running tests, test/main.js is the next stop, where more paths are
 * defined that are test specific
 *
 * TODO: iterate on this explanation, explain what require is really doing b/c
 * it's use is pretty involved in the generator output and people will really
 * appreciate a full example and explanation as given here(I never saw one like
 * this while googling at least).
